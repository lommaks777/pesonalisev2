# Deployment Checklist - Personalization Engine Refactoring

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Database Status
- [x] Transcript migration completed (12/12 lessons)
- [x] All lessons have `content.transcription` field populated
- [x] Migration report generated and reviewed
- [x] Database backup created (via migration script logging)

### Code Readiness
- [x] New personalization engine implemented (`lib/services/personalization-engine.ts`)
- [x] API routes updated to use new engine
- [x] Legacy code marked as deprecated
- [x] Test script validates quality (100% score)
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] No breaking changes to database schema
- [x] No breaking changes to API response format

### Testing Status
- [x] Unit test (via test script): ✅ Passed
- [x] Quality validation: ✅ 100% (6/6 checks)
- [x] Transcript loading: ✅ Working
- [x] AI generation: ✅ Working (34s avg)
- [x] JSON parsing: ✅ Validated
- [ ] Integration test: Survey submission end-to-end
- [ ] Production user test: Re-generate for 1-2 test users

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Silent Launch (Current Status)
**Objective**: New system active for new submissions only

- [x] Deploy code to production
- [x] New survey submissions use new engine automatically
- [x] Existing user personalizations unchanged
- [ ] Monitor error logs for 24-48 hours
- [ ] Verify new personalizations stored correctly
- [ ] Check API response times (acceptable: <60s for full survey)

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero errors in production logs
- All new survey submissions complete successfully
- Quality spot-check: 3-5 new personalizations reviewed

### Phase 2: Test User Migration
**Objective**: Validate new engine with existing user data

**Script**: `scripts/update-user-personalizations.ts` (updated)

**Test Users** (select 2-3):
```bash
# Example usage
npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/update-user-personalizations.ts 21179358
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. Run script for test user
2. Verify all 12 lessons regenerated
3. Review quality of generated content
4. Compare with old personalizations (manual review)
5. Collect feedback from test user (if possible)

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% regeneration success rate
- Quality equal or better than old system
- No errors during generation
- Database integrity maintained

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout
**Objective**: Migrate all existing users

**Options**:

**Option A: Batch Migration** (Recommended)
```bash
# Migrate users in batches of 10
for userId in $(cat user_list.txt | head -10); do
  npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/update-user-personalizations.ts $userId
  sleep 30  # Rate limiting
done
```

**Option B: On-Demand Migration**
- Wait for users to re-submit survey
- New personalizations generated automatically
- Gradual, natural migration over time

**Recommended**: Option A for active users, Option B for inactive

**Timeline**:
- Week 1: Migrate top 10% active users
- Week 2: Migrate next 30% active users
- Week 3: Migrate remaining active users
- Ongoing: On-demand for inactive users

### Phase 4: Template Archive
**Objective**: Clean up deprecated files

**Actions**:
```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p store/shvz/_archived_templates

# Move template JSON files
mv store/shvz/*-final.json store/shvz/_archived_templates/
mv store/shvz/*-final-backup.json store/shvz/_archived_templates/

# Keep transcripts and other essential files
# Do NOT move *.txt files (these are still used)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Template files archived but preserved
- No file system dependencies in active code
- Documentation updated

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Technical Metrics to Track

**Performance**:
- [ ] Average generation time per lesson
- [ ] API timeout rate
- [ ] Success/failure rate
- [ ] Retry usage frequency

**Cost**:
- [ ] OpenAI API usage (tokens)
- [ ] Daily API costs
- [ ] Cost per student
- [ ] Compare to projected $0.84/student

**Quality**:
- [ ] Manual review of 10 random personalizations/day
- [ ] Quality score tracking
- [ ] Field population rate

### Business Metrics to Track

**Engagement** (measure after 30 days):
- [ ] Lesson view rate (target: +20%)
- [ ] Time to first lesson view (target: -20%)
- [ ] Course completion rate (target: +15%)
- [ ] Student satisfaction (target: ≥4.5/5)

**Dashboard**: Set up monitoring in analytics tool

## Rollback Plan

### Trigger Conditions
Rollback if any of:
- Error rate >5% for new personalizations
- Quality degradation confirmed
- Costs exceed 2x projection
- Critical bugs discovered

### Rollback Procedure

**Step 1: Immediate Mitigation**
```typescript
// In app/api/survey/route.ts
// Comment out new engine, uncomment old:

// OLD (rollback to this):
// const template = await loadLessonTemplate(lesson.lesson_number);
// const personalization = await personalizeLesson(template, survey, userName, lessonInfo);

// NEW (currently active):
const transcriptData = await loadLessonTranscript(lesson.id);
const personalization = await generatePersonalizedDescription(...);
```

**Step 2: Redeploy**
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>  # Revert to last stable version
vercel deploy --prod
```

**Step 3: Communicate**
- Notify team of rollback
- Document root cause
- Plan fix

**Recovery Time**: <15 minutes

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Week 1
- [ ] Daily error log review
- [ ] Manual quality spot-checks (5-10 personalizations)
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Cost tracking

### Week 2-4
- [ ] Migrate test users
- [ ] Collect feedback
- [ ] A/B test results (if applicable)
- [ ] Begin gradual rollout

### Month 2
- [ ] Measure business metrics
- [ ] Full migration complete
- [ ] Archive old template system
- [ ] Retrospective meeting

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in production:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<production-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-key>  # Optional, for scripts
OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai-key>
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Test on production
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/survey \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"real_name":"Test User","course":"shvz",...}'
```
